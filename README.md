### About the Project
IntelliChef is a full-stack, AI-powered recipe assistant and culinary companion. It is designed to inspire creativity in the kitchen, streamline meal preparation, and help users make the most of their available ingredients. The application will leverage AI to generate unique recipes based on user inputs and preferences.

### üöß Current Progress
This project is under active development.
* **Backend:** The core backend skeleton is complete, utilizing **Spring Boot**, **JPA** with **Hibernate**, and **PostgreSQL** for the database.
* **Authentication:** Basic user authentication and the foundational recipe model are in place.
* **AI Integration:** I am currently focused on integrating **Spring AI** to enable the core recipe generation feature.
* **Frontend:** The React frontend is a work in progress and will connect to the backend once the core API is ready.

### üöÄ Planned Features
* AI-powered recipe generation based on ingredients, dietary needs, and cuisine style.
* User profiles to save favorite recipes and meal plans.
* A user-friendly interface for Browse and searching for recipes.
* Integration with external APIs for nutritional information.
